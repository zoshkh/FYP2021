These codes were used in for my final year project to test the CAPM, Fama and French 3-factor and Carhart 4-factor models on beta-sorted, size and B/M, and size and momentum portfolios.
Python codes are for the cross-sectional test from Fama and Macbeth (1973).
GRS_R file is for GRS test from Gibbons et al. (1989).


Raw data folders are for price downloading and beta sorting
Clean files are already sorted, cleaned and downloaded data plus data from Kenneth French Library.

Follow in file instructions to modify the codes from 3-factor to 4-factor model testing or vice versa.
